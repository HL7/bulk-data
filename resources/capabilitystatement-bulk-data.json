The complete list of FHIR profiles, RESTful operations, and search parameters supported by FHIR Bulk Data Servers are defined. Systems implementing this capability statement should meet the requirements set by the [Bulk Data Implementation Guide](https://fhir.org/ig/HL7/bulk-data/). FHIR Bulk Data Clients have the option of choosing from this list to access necessary data based on their local use cases and other contextual requirements.",

This supports use cases like backing up a server or exporting terminology data by restricting the resources returned using the _type parameter.\n1. Obtain data on all patients listed in a single FHIR Group Resource. If a FHIR server supports Group-level data export, it SHOULD support reading and searching for Group resource. This enables clients to discover available groups based on stable characteristics such as Group.identifier. Note: How these groups are defined is implementation specific for each FHIR system. For example, a payer may send a healthcare institution a roster file that can be imported into their EHR to create or update a FHIR group. Group membership could be based upon explicit attributes of the patient, such as: age, sex or a particular condition such as PTSD or Chronic Opioid use, or on more complex attributes, such as a recent inpatient discharge or membership in the population used to calculate a quality measure. FHIR-based group management is out of scope for the current version of this implementation guide.\n1. Export data from a FHIR server for all data associated with patients. This supports use cases like transmitting all data about patients or clinical care between systems.",
